# Co jemy?


Do you want to cook something and you don’t remember recipe?

Do you have to check it out in the Internet everytime?

Do you know it? I know it very well.

That’s why I’m creating app where you can:

✅ Put your recipes for dinner and cakes

✅ Add you shopping list in another tab

✅ Remove something from your list if you have it already

The app will be your own repository with recipes and you will not have to search everytime in website :blush:
