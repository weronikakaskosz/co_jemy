Do you want to cook something and you don’t remember recipe?

Do you have to check it out on the Internet every time?

Do you know it? I know it very well.

That’s why I’m creating an app where you can:

✅ Put your recipes for dinners and cakes

✅ Add you shopping list in another tab

✅ Remove something from your list if you have it already

The app will be your own repository with recipes and you will not have to search every time on websites :blush:
